Barp is a simple menu bar manager for macOS. It is based on Ice by jordan baird and maintains only the essential features for hiding and showing menu bar icons.

## Requirements

Barp requires macOS 14 or later.

## Updates

Barp is continuously being updated. However its primary purpose is already achieved. Future updates might include things like UI improvements in Barp's settings.

## Breaking Changes

Due to changes in APIs within macOS, Barp may behave incorrectly or stop working entirely. In that case, check back on this repository for updates.
